LeagueIconChanger is a simple application mostly designed for People to not get scammed.
Let me explain: Its currently possible to change your Summoner Icon to one of the chinese ones. (Example: [Icon](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Summoner_icon?file=Tencent_Lux_profileicon.png))
And it has come to my attention that people actually hand over their accounts to somebody to change it for money. And since id like people to not get scammed of their account, i made this application.
